                <h2>Core Classes</h2>
                <p>These classes are required for anyone majoring in computer science. With the exception of CS 2110 and CS 2800 (which are often taken together), it is generally recommended that students should take one core class each semester. However, that isn‚Äôt to say taking more than one (say, CS 4820 and CS 3410) is impossible. See the Alternatives to the Core Classes section below for alternate classes, and why you might want to take them instead.</p>

                    content="
                    The first course in the computer science sequence, this is a recommended course to take for all newcomers. It will cover all the necessary skills that every coder has with them, from variables to functions and beyond. Can be waived with AP Computer Science credit (may vary in CAS and CoE departments, however).
                    <br></br>
                    The class is historically taught by Walker White in the fall and then a pair of professors in the Spring. Because the Spring curriculum is based off Professor Walker‚Äôs personally designed Fall curriculum, there shouldn‚Äôt be any major differences in taking it in either semester. Also because it is an introductory class into the CS world, the class tends to have a large number of consultants whose jobs are also to give advice and insight into the rest of the CS major. There are one-on-one meetings designed into the class for any questions you may have, so make sure to take advantage of those resources if you need them.
                    <br></br>
                    The projects are very straightforward and as long as you‚Äôre paying attention in class/lab and reading instructions carefully, you‚Äôll do well. The most noteworthy project is the last one where you‚Äôll be tasked to build your own version of Breakout.
                    <br></br>
                    Projects can be done in pairs of two or alone. While it might be beneficial to have a partner to talk with, be careful in dividing up work ‚Äì since this is an introductory class, you definitely want to get good grasp of the course material.

                    Typically taught by David Gries and one other CS professor, this class forms the core of many CS topics and forms the basis of general CS knowledge. Many 4000 level courses will have this class as their highest requirement. A very large portion of programming interviews use material from this class.

                    This class has a lighter amount of work compared to other CS classes. There are seven projects which can be completed with a partner. There are two prelims and an optional final. Grades in homeworks are typically very high (~90) while prelim grades follow a normal distribution (average between 65 and 75). This means that prelims are weighted heavily when deciding grades, so study up.

Although different professors have been teaching it since, the problem sets remain somewhat difficult and much more advanced concepts, such as Turing machines, context-free grammar, computability, and NP-complete problems have been discussed in class in the past year. Prelims have generally been in-class prelims for the past semesters. This last semester, however, prelims were changed to regular evening exams.

                    content="This course introduces you to the paradigm of functional programming in a language called OCaml, which may be quite different from anything you‚Äôve seen until now. The goal of the course is not to just teach you a fancy new programming style but to use it as a tool to help you learn to be better software engineers overall. Topics covered include:

                    Usually the course is a general introduction to functional programming concepts and how they can be applied to real software engineering, but sometimes the course is more mathematical/theoretical, going into depth on topics such as type theory and the constructive real numbers.
                    <br></br>
                    The course consists of lectures as well as but also two weekly recitations taught by undergraduate TAs. The recitations are a fantastic resource for not only asking questions and clarifying concepts with peers, but also gaining hands-on experience, as some recitations involve coding. Recitations will not only go in-depth of important topics covered in lecture, but also cover topics more directly related to problem sets.

                    This course, like CS 3410, is a significant jump in difficulty/workload from CS 2110, so it would definitely be wise to start projects early and stay on top of the material if you haven‚Äôt gotten into this habit already. There are usually 5-7 projects that consist mostly of programming in OCaml. In the past, the course has varied with regards to working with partners. Last time it was taught by Constable, for example, it featured mostly individual projects; only one was in pairs. There has also been semesters where all projects were pair or group projects. In Clarkson last offering the first few projects were individual, while the next few were (optionally) done with a partner, and the final project was a group project (mandatory) with 3-4 team members. Historically, this final project allows each group more freedom in their software engineering choices, but also expects much more creativity and ingenuity to come from the assignment.

                    PA1-3 require you to make a MIPS pipelined-processor through a simulation program called Logisim, which is used to build circuits. You will get familiarized with Logisim through PA1, where you will build an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic calculations. In PA2 and PA3, you will build a functioning five-stage MIPS processor that executes various instructions. PA3 builds on PA2 but is considered to be harder than PA2 since it can be tricky to figure out all the edge cases. PA4 is a friendly hacking challenge which requires you to craft some input to a simplified browser and cause it to print out a different message as its default one. You will essentially be performing a buffer overflow attack on the browser. The last projects, PA5-6, involve writing tests for dynamic memory allocator (malloc) in C and then implementing malloc. A lot of problems arise due to the fact that students are still unfamiliar with commons errors found in C.

                    Naturally, this class moves fast since it has to cover materials covered in both ECE 2300 and CS 3420. Reading the book will be a very good supplement. Overall, the materials covered in the class are important to master for any choice of career in CS. The course is also good to know for CS 4410 (Operating Systems), since the material continues approximately where 3410 left off and students use the same tools that you‚Äôve learned here for OS projects.

Even if you are signed up for CS 4411, there will usually be 1 or 2 MPs you are still required to do. In the past, there have generally been 4 MPs on the following topics:
                    <br></br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Synchronization questions involving semaphores and monitors, and race conditions (done in Python)</li>
                    <li>Implementing malloc (done in C) [may change in fall 2017 due to this now being covered in CS 3410]</li>
                    <li>Implementing a given protocol (done in Python)</li>
                    <li>Implementing a part of a file system (has been done in both Python and C before)</li></ul>
                
                    The projects themselves aren‚Äôt too difficult. The first one will be very helpful for preparing for the first prelim and provide students exposure to synchronization questions. For the rest, try to read over the writeup for the projects very carefully, as even overlooking a minor detail may cost you a significant amount of points, especially as grading for many of the assignments is completely decided by the autograder test cases. Never break the 12 commandments of synchronization!
                    <br></br>
                    Another general advice for the MPs would be to try to sketch out what you will be doing before actually implementing the code. Although this is a general advice that can apply to virtually any CS class, this is especially important in OS when you have to, say, implement a protocol that will be designed to respond in a specific manner depending on the context.

Almost all of the problems involve (1) coming up with an algorithm to solve the problem of interest (2) write a proof to explain why the algorithm you proposed solves the problem (3) reason about runtime when applicable. Starting Spring 2016, some problem sets actually included a problem that involved coding in Java.

                    Some helpful advice for the class includes‚Ä¶
                    <ul>
                    <li>the textbook, written by Cornell professors (Eva Tardos and Jon Kleinberg) is super comprehensive and is structured just like the lectures. If you ever had to buy a textbook, this would be the most helpful one in terms of how much it will actually help you with the class</li>
                    <li>even if you plan to put off doing the problem set until a later time, try to read the problems as soon as they are released. Just thinking about the problems in your downtime can save a lot of time when you actually get down to doing it</li>
                    <li>if you haven‚Äôt used LaTeX much up until this point‚Ä¶ be prepared! Sometimes typing up your answers can take longer time than actually doing the problem, so make sure to always leave enough time to type.</li></ul>
                    <b>üìÖ Offered:</b> Every semester
                    <br>
                    <b>‚òëÔ∏è Prerequisites:</b> CS 2800 and CS 3110
                    <br>
                    <b>üìî Historical Median Grade:</b> This seems to vary wildly depending the professor; with Professor Tardos, the median was an A-. With Professor Kleinberg (Bobby), the median was a B/B+
                    <br>
                    <b>‚è∞ Workload:</b> The best description of the workload for CS 4820 is constant. With weekly problem sets, there is not much downtime of not actually having something due. Once you start using your late days as well, you may end up in a situation where you have to do 2 problem sets in one week."
